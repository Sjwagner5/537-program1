This program recreates the linux command ps. The user can pass in a pid to get information about that process.
The available options to display are: the process's state, the user time, the system time, the virtual memory
and the command line to run the program. If a pid is not specified, this information is displayed for all of
the current user's processes. The command line and user time are displayed by default, but can be turned off
with -c- and -U- respectively. All other options default to off. I did not have a partner for this project so
all code is my own.
